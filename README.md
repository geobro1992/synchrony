# Niche partitioning and a storage effect facilitate coexistence in an amphibian community
Pond-breeding amphibians that utilise ephemeral wetlands provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate theoretical predictions of community composition in stochastic environments. Here, we explore the interplay between biotic and abiotic conditions in shaping amphibian communities at two ephemeral wetlands on Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.

## Contents
**df_dat.csv** contains the raw drift fence captures.

**50_arrivals.csv** contains the dates when 50% of animals within each species have arrived at breeding wetland.

**75_arrivals.csv** contains the dates when 75% of animals within each species have arrived at breeding wetland.

**90_arrivals.csv** contains the dates when 90% of animals within each species have arrived at breeding wetland.

**community_dynamics.R** contains the code to calculate Pielouâ€™s evenness, conduct a circular regression of arrival times, and correlate environmental conditions with the degree of synchrony in the timing of movements.
